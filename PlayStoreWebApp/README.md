This folder contains the **`ui.R`** and **`server.R`** files for the RShiny dashboard.
These 2 files have been separated for better code readability and understandability.

* The **`ui.R`** file defines the layout and structure of the web app, including the placement of different input controls, charts, and text elements.
It determines how the app looks and interacts with the user.

* The **`server.R`** file contains the code that handles the logic and data processing behind the scenes.
It retrieves and manipulates the data, performs calculations, and generates dynamic outputs based on user interactions.

Together, the **`ui.R`** and **`server.R`** files form the backbone of the RShiny web app, providing an intuitive and engaging experience for exploring the Google Play Store data.
